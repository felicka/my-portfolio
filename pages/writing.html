              <h3>My Writing Experience</h3>
              <p>
                My love for writing and my BA in Creative Writing has added to
                my years of writing experience. Not only with personal projects,
                but also with shared ones. I’ve been blogging on and off for ten
                years, sharing my travels, personal experiences, and book
                reviews and recommendations. Some other writing-related skills
                include beta reading and proofreading.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of my short stories has been published in YOU Magazine and
                several more are on submission.

            Book Review - The Bear and the Nightingale by Katherine Arden
          </h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Bear and the Nightingale by Katherine Arden is steeped in lush
            writing and folklore. Set in medieval Russia, with wintery
            landscapes and thick forests. It’s like being transported back in
            time without having to suffer the brutal cold and hunger like the
            characters. The story follows a young girl into her adolescent
            years, and how she lives and handles being a free spirit in a strict
            community. Told in the third person POV, the reader gets to
            experience several different perspectives without losing touch with
            the heart of the story.
          </p>
          <p>
            Folk tales are intricately laced throughout, but what really makes
            everything come alive is the writing style. It’s like reading a
            fairy-tale and then becoming a part of it. The vivid descriptions
            transport the reader into the story and take them on a journey along
            with all their senses. The descriptions of food were enough to make
            me crave an array of plain yet tasteful dishes. My favorites are
            honey-wine, cheese and mushroom pie, and a loaf of black bread.
            Russian names and words are scattered throughout, immersing the
            reader even further into the story. The fairy tales served as a
            basis for the story and were weaved into the main plotline. It was
            refreshing to read fairy tales I didn’t grow up with, especially in
            the context of a grander fairy-tale.
          </p>
          <p>
            The story was solid from start to end. The characters are
            intriguing, and each memorable in their own way. Reaching the end
            left me craving more. Luckily, it is part of a trilogy, so two more
            books are waiting for me to devour them. I recommend this book to
            anyone who loves fairy tales, folk tales, and medieval settings. If
            the writing doesn’t pull you in, some other element will.
