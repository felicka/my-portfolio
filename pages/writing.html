              Book Review - The Bear and the Nightingale by Katherine Arden</b
            >
          </h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Bear and the Nightingale by Katherine Arden is steeped in lush
            writing and folklore. Set in medieval Russia, with wintery
            landscapes and thick forests. It’s like being transported back in
            time without having to suffer the brutal cold and hunger like the
            characters. The story follows a young girl into her adolescent
            years, and how she lives and handles being a free spirit in a strict
            community. Told in the third person POV, the reader gets to
            experience several different perspectives without losing touch with
            the heart of the story.
          </p>
          <p>
            Folk tales are intricately laced throughout, but what really makes
            everything come alive is the writing style. It’s like reading a
            fairy-tale and then becoming a part of it. The vivid descriptions
            transport the reader into the story and take them on a journey along
            with all their senses. The descriptions of food were enough to make
            me crave an array of plain yet tasteful dishes. My favorites are
            honey-wine, cheese and mushroom pie, and a loaf of black bread.
            Russian names and words are scattered throughout, immersing the
            reader even further into the story. The fairy tales served as a
            basis for the story and were weaved into the main plotline. It was
            refreshing to read fairy tales I didn’t grow up with, especially in
            the context of a grander fairy-tale.
          </p>
          <p>
            The story was solid from start to end. The characters are
            intriguing, and each memorable in their own way. Reaching the end
            left me craving more. Luckily, it is part of a trilogy, so two more
            books are waiting for me to devour them. I recommend this book to
            anyone who loves fairy tales, folk tales, and medieval settings. If
            the writing doesn’t pull you in, some other element will.

            <b> Day in Cape Town</b>
          </h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            I visited Cape Town when I was young, but when we are young, we
            often don’t take in everything around us, or our focus centers on
            specific aspects. Our memories change and we forget details. Years
            later I visited Cape Town again and it was a new experience with
            some faint recognition. I remembered basic moments, the blue ocean,
            the haunted castle, and of course, Table Mountain. I’m sure if I
            think about it more memories will surface. But for now, I’ll share
            the new ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            My favorite part about my day in Cape town was being able to spend
            it with my best friend. With Table Mountain to the one side and the
            ocean to the other, the V&A Waterfront was where our day started.
            This shopping destination is divided into five sections. The
            Watershed was first on our agenda. A building dedicated to local
            talent and crafts. With something for everyone, whether you need a
            gift or want a souvenir. When we finally built up an appetite, the
            V&A Food Market was next. The old building has a variety of food and
            beverage options. Whatever you prefer, there is sure to be something
            to satisfy your craving. We decided on an amazing stall called Lua
            Poke, where you choose fillings for a spring roll or toppings for a
            bowl. We went with bowls and had the option of rice, noodles, or
            kale. The next step was choosing a protein – I chose tofu. And then
            vegetables and toppings. It was delicious and I highly recommend it.
          </p>
          <p>
            From there we walked to Cape Town city center. It was an easy path
            to follow between maps and signs provided along the way. And when in
            doubt follow the tourists. As we approached the center, we came
            across a market that sold all kinds of items, from clothing to
            books. I would suggest keeping your valuable belongings close by,
            some parts of the city are quite crowded, and tourists stand out
            like gold.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of our main agendas for the day was to meet up with the friend
            who introduced us. It was lovely to catch up, reminisce about times
            past, and discuss our future plans. We met at Truth, one of the best
            coffeehouses in the world. It is steampunk themed, which added to
            the ambient atmosphere. All the staff dressed in steampunk clothes
            and the decor was on point. I suggest visiting the restroom, even if
            it is just to wash your hands, you won’t regret it. Afterward, we
            made our way back to the waterfront. We found a great spot to have a
            mini photoshoot. It overlooked the water where numerous container
            ships, fishing boats, and sailing boats hovered on the water. It was
            very picturesque. Throughout the city, the diversity of buildings
            offers some great photo spots.
          </p>

            Cape town is a combination of unique sights, natural beauty,
            unforgettable cuisine, and multiple attractions. Visiting as an
            adult made the experience feel like revisiting the past. If you
            visit, prepare to fall in love, because some parts of Cape Town will
            capture your heart.
