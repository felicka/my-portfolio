              Book Review - The Bear and the Nightingale by Katherine Arden</b
            >
          </h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Bear and the Nightingale by Katherine Arden is steeped in lush
            writing and folklore. Set in medieval Russia, with wintery
            landscapes and thick forests. It’s like being transported back in
            time without having to suffer the brutal cold and hunger like the
            characters. The story follows a young girl into her adolescent
            years, and how she lives and handles being a free spirit in a strict
            community. Told in the third person POV, the reader gets to
            experience several different perspectives without losing touch with
            the heart of the story.
          </p>
          <p>
            Folk tales are intricately laced throughout, but what really makes
            everything come alive is the writing style. It’s like reading a
            fairy-tale and then becoming a part of it. The vivid descriptions
            transport the reader into the story and take them on a journey along
            with all their senses. The descriptions of food were enough to make
            me crave an array of plain yet tasteful dishes. My favorites are
            honey-wine, cheese and mushroom pie, and a loaf of black bread.
            Russian names and words are scattered throughout, immersing the
            reader even further into the story. The fairy tales served as a
            basis for the story and were weaved into the main plotline. It was
            refreshing to read fairy tales I didn’t grow up with, especially in
            the context of a grander fairy-tale.
          </p>
          <p>
            The story was solid from start to end. The characters are
            intriguing, and each memorable in their own way. Reaching the end
            left me craving more. Luckily, it is part of a trilogy, so two more
            books are waiting for me to devour them. I recommend this book to
            anyone who loves fairy tales, folk tales, and medieval settings. If
            the writing doesn’t pull you in, some other element will.

            <b> Day in Cape Town</b>
          </h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            I visited Cape Town when I was young, but when we are young, we
            often don’t take in everything around us, or our focus centers on
            specific aspects. Our memories change and we forget details. Years
            later I visited Cape Town again and it was a new experience with
            some faint recognition. I remembered basic moments, the blue ocean,
            the haunted castle, and of course, Table Mountain. I’m sure if I
            think about it more memories will surface. But for now, I’ll share
            the new ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            My favorite part about my day in Cape town was being able to spend
            it with my best friend. With Table Mountain to the one side and the
            ocean to the other, the V&A Waterfront was where our day started.
            This shopping destination is divided into five sections. The
            Watershed was first on our agenda. A building dedicated to local
            talent and crafts. With something for everyone, whether you need a
            gift or want a souvenir. When we finally built up an appetite, the
            V&A Food Market was next. The old building has a variety of food and
            beverage options. Whatever you prefer, there is sure to be something
            to satisfy your craving. We decided on an amazing stall called Lua
            Poke, where you choose fillings for a spring roll or toppings for a
            bowl. We went with bowls and had the option of rice, noodles, or
            kale. The next step was choosing a protein – I chose tofu. And then
            vegetables and toppings. It was delicious and I highly recommend it.
          </p>
          <p>
            From there we walked to Cape Town city center. It was an easy path
            to follow between maps and signs provided along the way. And when in
            doubt follow the tourists. As we approached the center, we came
            across a market that sold all kinds of items, from clothing to
            books. I would suggest keeping your valuable belongings close by,
            some parts of the city are quite crowded, and tourists stand out
            like gold.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of our main agendas for the day was to meet up with the friend
            who introduced us. It was lovely to catch up, reminisce about times
            past, and discuss our future plans. We met at Truth, one of the best
            coffeehouses in the world. It is steampunk themed, which added to
            the ambient atmosphere. All the staff dressed in steampunk clothes
            and the decor was on point. I suggest visiting the restroom, even if
            it is just to wash your hands, you won’t regret it. Afterward, we
            made our way back to the waterfront. We found a great spot to have a
            mini photoshoot. It overlooked the water where numerous container
            ships, fishing boats, and sailing boats hovered on the water. It was
            very picturesque. Throughout the city, the diversity of buildings
            offers some great photo spots.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cape town is a combination of unique sights, natural beauty,
            unforgettable cuisine, and multiple attractions. Visiting as an
            adult made the experience feel like revisiting the past. If you
            visit, prepare to fall in love, because some parts of Cape Town will
            capture your heart.

            <b> 3 Reasons to Visit Prague</b>
          </h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Visiting Prague is like stepping back in time or falling into a
            fairytale. Amongst the cobbled streets is not only breath-taking
            architecture, but also memorable cuisine, and endless photo
            opportunities. The appeal isn’t necessarily in one aspect, but how
            they entwine to form this magical city.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-center">ARCHITECTURE</h4>
          <p>
            Unlike some cities where certain art styles are more prominent,
            Prague boasts Baroque, Gothic, Renaissance, and Romanesque
            architecture. They morph the city into a map of curiosities. The
            Charles Bridge crosses the Vltava River, connecting Old Town with
            Lesser Town. This walk over the water gives one various viewpoints
            of the city. Along the way one passes various painters, musicians,
            and vendors, sharing glimpses into the heart of the city. Other
            points of interest include Prague Castle, St. Vitus Cathedral,
            Lesser Town, Old Town, and the famous Astronomical Clock. More
            modern architecture can also be found. The Franz Kafka Statue, the
            Dancing Houses, and the Crawling Babies in Kampa Park are some of
            the most bizarre, yet intriguing. Even if you don’t have a set
            agenda, and you’re just strolling around, you are bound to find some
            interesting landmark or unique building.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-center">CUISINE</h4>
          <p>
            The food has a medieval atmosphere to it. Simplistic recipes
            enriched with flavors and lingering aromas. Most dishes in Prague
            are comforting and filling. Some popular dishes include goulash,
            schnitzel, grilled sausages, dumplings, pancakes, and bread bowls.
            For a proper historical atmosphere, one can partake in a medieval
            dining experience. Beverages are often overlooked. But if you like
            alcoholic drinks, you are sure to find something you like in Prague.
            Known for its potency, absinthe can be found all over. As well as
            Becherovka, a herbal bitter liqueur drink. Beer lovers will be happy
            to hear that Prague has a variety of some of the best beers on the
            planet.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-center">PICTURESQUE</h4>
          <p>
            Whether you use a DSRL or prefer to snap memories with your phone,
            Prague has an abundance of picturesque places. The Charles Bridge is
            amongst the most popular. Each area brings serves up a different
            background, making it perfect for those throw-back-Thursday travel
            posts. If you want to avoid other tourists, head over earlier in the
            morning. The fewer people around, the more magical the atmosphere
            and photographs. Other photo approved placed include the John Lennon
            Wall, along the Vltava River, Nerudova Street, and Letná Hill.
          </p>
          <p>
            Artistic undertones run throughout the city. Whether you love art,
            history, food, or adventures, Prague is a city that will offer you
            something of everything. Have a few landmarks on your list but don’t
            hesitate to stroll down empty streets and see where they take you.
            Let the city show you its secrets.

            <b> Reading What You Want</b>
          </h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            If you love reading like I do, you know reading a book you don’t
            like is torture. I’m grateful for the required books that came into
            my life. Some had decent life lessons, others became favorites, but
            most introduced me to the kind of book I wanted to avoid (if not
            burn). They have served their purpose, whether they had a negative
            or positive outcome or influence on me. In university most of my
            English Literature books were bearable. My introduction to Angela
            Carter was godsent, and I do thank my required reading list for it.
          </p>
          <p>
            But school isn’t the only influencer of reading material. Those
            summer-reading lists and NYT bestseller stickers are just as much to
            blame. Yes, those books are regarded as great reading material for
            several reasons. But that does not mean that those reasons apply to
            you. Just because a thousand people have left 5-star reviews on
            Goodreads and Amazon, does not mean you have to force yourself to
            read it if you know it’s not your cup of tea.
          </p>
          <p>My reading decisions are finally my own.</p>
          <p>
            Opening a book physically or on your reading device should bring
            joy, not dread and urgency to just get it over with. The last
            several books I have read have been on my reading list for a while.
            All books I knew I was going to fall in love with. The first one
            gave me so much satisfaction and fullness, that I’ve only been
            reading books I want to. Not only have I been reading faster
            (because I enjoy it), but I’ve also been reading more because I look
            forward to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, sometimes I must sit through boring books in the name of
            research. But for the most part, I’ve learned how important it is to
            keep the embers of intrigue aglow. Make a list of books you want to
            read before you die or want to complete before the end of the year.
            But make sure it’s books that excite you. Yes, the cover can be
            beautiful, but if the synopsis doesn’t stir something inside of you,
            maybe pick a different book.

            The vending machine waited patiently for me to make up my mind as I
            scanned the pieces of art and descriptions for the third time,
            making sure I didn’t miss one. Most slots were tempting, but one
            stood out from the rest. I pulled a crisp five-dollar bill from my
            wallet and fed it to the machine, watching as it swallowed Benjamin
            Franklin. I pulled the lever and was rewarded with a loud ‘clunk’
            that vibrated through the quiet museum room. Smiling, I picked up
            the object. My five dollars were replaced by a piece of unique
            pocket-sized art. I thanked the gods for the marvel that is the
            Art-o-mat and for Clark Whittington who invented it. Do you have any
            questions? Are you wondering what exactly I’m talking about? Good.
            Because I have all the answers. Today I’ll be sharing everything
            Art-o-Mat-related, from its birth, locations, artist contribution,
            and even some tips when you decide to go find one in the wild!

          <h4 class="text-center">WHAT IS AN ART-O-MAT?</h4>
          <p>
            An Art-0-Mat is a “retired” cigarette vending machine that now
            dispenses art instead of cigarettes. Yes, you heard right. Instead
            of a box of death sticks, one gets a piece of art. Some artworks are
            painted blocks of wood, while others are boxes with a piece of art
            inside. There are a variety of different art mediums from artists
            all over the world.

          <h4 class="text-center">WHERE DID IT START?</h4>
          <p>
            It all started with the Pavlovian theory. This is when something
            triggers a certain response. Like smelling coffee and then craving
            it, even if you don’t like it. In this case, a friend of Clark
            Whittington’s had a Pavlovian reaction to the crinkling of
            cellophane. When he heard a snack being opened, he had the
            overwhelming craving to have one as well. As most smokers would
            know, opening cellophane packaging can create the same effect. When
            a packet is being opened it often triggers the craving to smoke a
            cigarette, especially if it isn’t your packet.

            In 1997, Clark Whittington debuted the re-used cigarette machine at
            a local café in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Inside were wooden
            blocks mounted with some of his black and white photographs and
            wrapped in cellophane waiting to be purchased for $1 per piece.
            Cynthia Giles, the owner of the café, asked if the machine could
            stay permanently, and by doing so, started the Art-o-mat revolution.
            Today the artists of the Art-o-mat are known as Artists in
            Cellophane (AIC for short). The popularity has grown over the years
            and there are currently more than 100 Art-o-mats in use. The
            Art-o-mat has appeared in various magazines, newspapers, and news
            shows.<a href="../files/art-o-mat.pdf" target="_blank" class=""
